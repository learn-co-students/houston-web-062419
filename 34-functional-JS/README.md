# Functional JS

### Functions are Objects
* They are objects
* Can do anything you can do with other objects
* Store in variables
* Pass as arguments to other functions
* Return from functions
* Arrow Function

### Highorder functions:
* Function that accept other functions as arguments and/or return a function

### Callback functions:
* Functions passed as an argument to another function or A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing

### Declarative versus imperative

### Pure functions
* The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input arguments
* Has no side-effects, meaning it doesn't change anything in the program

### composition
* Combine two or more functions to perform some computation

### Recursion
* Function calling itself
